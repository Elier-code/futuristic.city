                    <p>We have buildings that are capable of adapting to certain structures according to the needs of
                        the building, thanks to the microbots and nanotechnology with which they are made. For example,
                        a stadium can be converted into an auditorium or a park, depending on the architect or owner of
                        the building's wishes.
